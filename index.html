        <p>Project development <br>
          This week, our team discussed and exchanged ideas for the project. Initially, we were going to make a tracking token. But after further discussion,
          we decided that it was troublesome to bring a token, and the there is possibility of losing it. Instead, we went ahead with the idea of using an RFID
          tag to track attendance. The RFID tag would be attached to their clothing. This extinguishes the chances of it being lost. RFID tags are also small and flat,
          which makes it very convenient and portable.

          This week, we did a design thinking course, of which I had already completed previously in my cloud computing module. This course was helpful in helping us think in the perspective
          of the user, and helping us to brainstorm more creative ideas based upon that.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we got hold of some of the hardware. Namely, the RDIF chip, RDIF scanner, the arduino and some wires to connect everything. We did some research on arduino and attempted
          to write code to scan the RDIF chip in the form of a card and keychain, but we were unsuccessful. So, I decided to take the hardware home and attempt again
          at home. I learnt how to connect the arduino, as well as how to code the arduino so that it connects successfully.

          This week, we learn more about scrum and how to apply it to our team. With these videos, our team was able to assign and identify roles
          within the team. I learnt more about how to apply the scrum framework to our project. Also, I learnt about the difference between the scrum framework and 
          agile methology.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we sucessfully coded the arduino. For now, we are still hard coding the mastertag,
          as we are still in progress with the database. I also set up a repository for our mobile app, and also created a figma
          project to plan out our app wireframe. I have also successfully connected the arduino to python. Now, the plan is to connect
          python to our app in android studios via bluetooth connection, to transfer over the UID of the card scanned. We decided to use a figma version
          of the app to start off with, and then transition over to a real android application after the hackathon. We are planning to make a 3D
          gantry in blender, and then 3D print out the gantry as a prototype.

          This week, we learned more about prototypes and its purpose. I also learned how to properly prototype an app on figma. This will
          be very helpful for our hackathon, as we are planning to use a figma prototype to showcase our app.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we successfully conected the bluetooth module to the arduino and RDIF scanner. The bluetooth module
          had a blinking light, to show that it was connected and ready to pair. At first, we had trouble with the wiring, as both the RDIF scanner and 
          bluetooth module required the 3.3v, and the arduino only had one 3.3v. To counter this, we decided to use a breadboard. After successfully connecting all
          the wires, it was time to adjust our code. We still have trouble connecting the bluetooth module to our phones. It successfully pairs, but fails to connect
          properly. However, we still made a lot of progress this week. We also found that the bluetooth module could only successfully pair with android devices. This 
          could be due to the fact that it still lacks the ability to connect, but not to pair.

          This week, we learned about software patterns and architecture. We learned more about how to create software architecture diagrams, as well as how they are useful 
        and important. Software architecture is the fundamental organization and structure of a software system. It defines the system's components or modules, their relationships,
         and how they interact to achieve the system's goals and requirements</aside>

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we sucessfully enabled the bluetooth module, so that it pairs and connects successfully with both android and ios.
          We also added indicative elements to our prototype. We added an led light bulb and a buzzer. The led light turns red when the wrong card is used, and 
          the buzzer plays the corresponding audio cue. When the correct card is used, the led lights up green, and the buzzer plays the corresponding sound as
           well. At first, we struggled with the coding logic. We were stuck in a loop after the first time the card was verified. Eventually, we went to genius bar
           to ask for help. With their help, we were able to spot our coding error and fix it. Now, after your bluetooth disconnects, you can no longer scan your card.

          This week, we learned about presentation. We used these tips to make our powerpoint slides more presentable and eye-catching. We also made use of some of the 
          presentation tips, such as recovering from making mistakes while giving a speech. This is something I particularly struggle with, so it was helpful to read up on
          how to recover from it without people noticing there was a mistake made at all. In the end, the sponsor really enjoyed our presentation.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we made a repository for our application. We decided to make use of flutter to aid us in creating this application.
          We started to watch a lot of videos of how to utilise flutter with android studios. It was a struggle to even implement flutter into android studios. After we 
          overcame this struggle, we managed to finish the UI of the login page. For the app design, we decided to implement the design we already had from our figma. We
          also attempted to use an external software to convert the figma pages into dart programming language, but failed to successfully do so.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we made an effort to learn more about how flutter works. After learning more about flutter and its structure, 
          we also proceeded to start on the home page UI. We connected the login page to the home page. At first, it was difficult to grasp the concept of flutter, as 
          it is relatively different from what we were used to, which is using java in android studios. We had to pick up a new progamming language, dart. The benefit
          of flutter is that we were able to implement our app in both IOS and android.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we implemented the firebase authentication for our login page. This makes it so that the user has to login with a valid email and 
          password in order to gain access to the home page. At first, we had trouble with installing firebase into flutter. After numerous tries and watching many tutorial videos,
          we finally implemented it successfully. We also attempted to do the bluetooth function of our app. We were unsuccessful in implementing the bluetooth, we had a lot of trouble with
          setting up the bluetooth connection. We were unable to get a successful connection.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we continued on with the bluetooth. We tried to implement different bluetooth plugins, like bluetooth classic, flutter blue, etc. But none of them
          worked. So, we decided to move onto the attendance feature. We did the UI for the attendance feature by displaying a calendar table, and then carried on with attempting the bluetooth.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we did the real time database for the attendance. We implemented firebase real time database, to link to our attendance page. At this point, since our
          bluetooth was still not functioning, we decided to add a makeshift check in button in our attendance page. Although it was supposed to be an automated process with the bluetooth and the 
          RDIF card, we still had to make do with what we had. We also had trouble with the calendar reflecting our data in the database. The dates that the user was present is supposed to be reflected in the
          table calendar, but it was not showing up like we intended.

        <p>Project Development<br>This week, we made the presentation slides and made our video showing our app. We did the presentation on monday. Although our product was unfinished, we tried our best to
          show off what we had intended to achieve. Our presentation was centered around what we had intended and what we had managed to complete so far.
