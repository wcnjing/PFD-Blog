        <p>This week, our team discussed and exchanged ideas for the project. Initially, we were going to make a tracking token. But after further discussion,
          we decided that it was troublesome to bring a token, and the there is possibility of losing it. Instead, we went ahead with the idea of using an RFID
          tag to track attendance. The RFID tag would be attached to their clothing. This extinguishes the chances of it being lost. RFID tags are also small and flat,
          which makes it very convenient and portable. </p>
